# Data Collector For Cryptocurrency Exchanges

The aim of this project is a data collector from exchanges. In particular, the Bitmex interface was implemented gathering order books. 

## Order Books

Order books are placeholders or slots for buyers and sellers on a specific asset. Every assets has its own order book.

From the automatic trading point of view, these are very insighful to exploit makerts via mining techniques.
